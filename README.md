# sys-cw

Switch sysmodule allowing you to open up tinfoil on DeepSea and other switch FW AiOs using Hekate.

It detects tinfoil starting, circumvents the arbitrary restrictions by blawar, detects when tinfoil is closing and reverts everything back.

## disclaimer

This repository is basically sys-clk by RetroNX but modified to fit my needs.
