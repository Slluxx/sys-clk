# sys-cw (Cling-Wrap)

Switch sysmodule allowing you to open up tinfoil on DeepSea and other switch FW AiOs using Hekate.

It detects tinfoil starting, circumvents the arbitrary restrictions by blawar, detects when tinfoil is closing and reverts everything back.

Cling-Wrap existed as [Overlay](https://github.com/wilsam239/Cling-Wrap-Tesla-Overlay) and [Homebrew](https://github.com/wilsam239/Cling-Wrap) before this sysmodule. I wrote this sysmodule to not render your switch useless when not disabling cling-wrap and then rebooting.

If you rather use Cling-Wrap as Overlay or Homebrew (because of memory limits), consider [CommonProblemResolver](https://github.com/Team-Neptune/CommonProblemResolver) (CPR) by Team-Neptune. Its a payload that can fix multiple things on your switch so you dont need a PC to fix it.
